To headlessly configure WiFi on your Pi, you can create the file /boot/wpa_supplicant.conf that contains the following lines:

ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=«your_ISO-3166-1_two-letter_country_code»

network={
    ssid="«your_SSID»"
    psk="«your_PSK»"
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}

where :
- your_ISO-3166-1_two-letter_country_code = FR for france or CA for canada you can get your country's ISO two lettre code from here 
https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search .
- your_SSID = your WiFi's name
- your_PSK = your WiFi's password

last step is SSH activation because it's desactivated by default in raspbian. And to do so, you only need to create /boot/ssh.
